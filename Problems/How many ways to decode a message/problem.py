How many ways to decode a message?

Given the following mapping:

'a' -> 1
'b' -> 2
'c' -> 3
...
'z' -> 26

We can convert a message like "ab" to "12".

Given a coded message, how many ways are to convert the coded message into the original one?

For example:

Coded message: "12"
Possible original messages: {"ab","l"} as ("a" -> 1 and b -> "2" ) and ("l" -> "12")
